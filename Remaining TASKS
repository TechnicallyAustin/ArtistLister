Create Song objects
    - When creating Songs need to fix associations with Artist
    - Creating a song needs to associate an artist if they exist or create a new one if they dont.
        -- This is currently all done in the Song class but I could seperate concerns 
            -- Some of my Song validations are failing as well.

Create Song Database
    - I need to create a drop down menu with artist ID's when creating a song
        - give a user the option to select from existing artists or make a new one.

Create a playlist that uses cookies
    - When a user adds a song object to a playlist, the playlist should be updated using cookies to maintain it's state.

Create artist objects
    - Artist objects can be creatined by themselves, or when a Song is created.
    - Artist only have a name but can belong to Songs and playlists.

Verify Associations
